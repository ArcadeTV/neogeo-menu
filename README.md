# MENU FOR NEO GEO 161in1 MULTICART 
- based on the work of [Vortex](https://github.com/xvortex/VTXCart)
- used Furrtek's "Hello World" [example code](https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?title=Hello_world_tutorial)

This aims to be an alternative menu for the chinese 161in1 multicart that was fully reverse engineered by vortex in 2023.
